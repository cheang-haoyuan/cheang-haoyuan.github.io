# cheang-haoyuan.github.io

This is a website of my casual artworks, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Took me a while to realise that GitHub pages only host static pages so the first 30 commits or so can be omitted ;-;
They are mostly setting up for a node project and some React.

**豆腐花**
Or pronounced as Doe-foo-fah, is the 'name' I use for my artworks. It is sort of a dessert that I quite like. Not really related, but I kinda ran out of ideas when thinking about usernames.

**Future Plans**
- Add different collections, or group my artworks that shared similar themes.
- Add sort function on gallery.
- Add search function.
- I might deploy this website on a different platform that supports backend codes. Currently the website is half written in Node.js and using MongoDB, you can still use ``npm start`` on your command prompt if the repo is cloned on your local device.
- IF I change where I host this website, might as well use react on front end.
- ``TL;DR`` i might redo the whole thing.
