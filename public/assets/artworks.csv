980917,together,png,3/04/2020,It was from a lineart I did back in 2019 and just. Forgot about it. Well mostly cause I do not want to colour it with my fingers that’s all.

980977,夜,png,29/03/2020,"My first ever big piece after getting a tablet hehehehehehe. I've always wanted to do a large canvas and a lot of amazing details. Unfortunately my skills are insufficient for such details so I went for just a big canvas. My favourite was actually the bookshelf, where I spent the most time on. I was pretty stressed my assignments at that time so this was actually my stress drawing. I drew the sky as well, but it wasnt that much fun just putting dots on your screen :)",night,faceless

Some background, maybe? I was in a highschool that likes to snoop into your hairstyles every single day and it kinda annoyed me. This person is wearing my highschool uniform, cutting their hair, and giving the finger. Essentially what I felt daily.
