				A word of warning, brace yourselves for my

				I literally have no control over those things soz.
				This is not a professional website :)

		          OHKAY, Let's get back to business~ <br>
		          <br>
		          In a nutshell, I'm a major perfectionist and try-hard that
							ironically also trying my best to NOT be a try-hard.
							In which it resulted in my being a big ball of stress 24/7 ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ.
		          <br>
		          yeh. Thats it. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

		      </p>
		      <p><del>nothin</del></p>
		      <p>
		        I am actually stu(dying) at the moment hueh.
		        I'm a uni student, currently studying User Design,
		        Discrete Mathematics, and Operations Research as my major(s),
		        and minoring in Computing and Graphic Design.
		        Quite a mixed bag I'd admit, but hey, I like to poke my
		        fingers in every pie I came across ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ.
		        <br>
		        I was a Design Consultant at Momentium Consulting,
		        and worked on UI/UX based projects. Sometimes I
		        might join a tech-based project, but usually I don't do
		        the hardcore coding there. I won't go into too much deets here,
		        as this is NOT my resume website : ) I made this for fun.
		        And talking about work is NOT fun : )
		        <br>
		        I might put up more links for each section on my works below,
		        so stay tuned :D
		      </p>

		      </del></p>
		      <p>
		        I draw. uh. yeh. Take a look at my gallery if you like? Careful, though.
						I stress draw A WHOLE HECKIN LOT, and sometimes my thoughts may
						surface a little too much, so umm, sorry not sorry?
						<br>
						If you're wondering, no I'm not okay ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ. I will be, some day.
						<br>
						but not today ; )
		        <br>
						<sub><del>
							tho i always hope people can still accept me eventhough im not ok,
							but that's wishful thinking i guess.

		        <br>
		        Ofc, my life is a joke, and I have the music to go with it (๑・ω-)～♥”
		        <br>
		        I play the clarinet in my uni's wind ensemble, (though not well)
						play the piano, and a little bit of guitar. yeh you get the "finger
						in many pies" thing now do you? I'm also learning to play the flute
						at the moment, idk how i cope but yeh.
		        I'm also a proud TwoSet Violin fan eventhough I don't have my
		        40 hours/day of practice, (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀) YET. I'M WORKING ON IT.
		        <br>
		        <br>
		        hmmm. something else about me?
		        <br>
		        if you're reading this far then i guess the answer is yes?
		        well if you say no then the close button is always there for you : )
		        <br>
						<br>
		        Anyway, I'm also into languages and stuff,
		        it'll be easier to show you in a list:

		        <ul id="languages">
		          <li>廣东话</li>
		          <li>Bahasa Malaysia</li>
		          <li>python</li>

		          <li>中文</li>
		          <li>MATLAB (controversial i know)</li>
		          <li>Tex</li>
		        </ul>

		        I'm also learning Japanese, Hokkien, and Hangul ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

		      <p>
		        literally the love(s) of my life.
		        <br>
		        Our eldest is Blacky, she was stray that just
		        wondered into our house back in 2008 and...stayed. ever since.
		        Smart and cheeky, she loves chewing on ice (weird i know),
		        sitting inside the house and looking at the garden for hours,
		        running away from home,
		        and of course, belly rubs.
		        <br>
		        Then we have Double, he was adopted via our local SPCA in 2014,
		        and likes sleeping in inconspicuous places. He lives in our backyard,
		        chillin' every single day. A little dense and clumsy,
		        he eats basically everything presented in front of him and enjoys
		        soft pets.
		        <br>
		        They both despise showers and it is always a big work trying to
		        catch em for showering (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)
						<br>
						<br>
						Ummm, my favourite vege are ladies' fingers, known by everyone
						else except my family as Okra. But usually they're quite expensive
						in where I live, so I would only buy them for my birthday.
						<br>
						<br>
						Oh I have favourite chemical compound! It is CaCO<sub>3</sub> (Calcium Carbonate),
						I like the way it just rolls off your tongue hehehe. As for my
						favourite number, it's just a boring 42. Nothing like pi or the
						golden ratio, just 42.
